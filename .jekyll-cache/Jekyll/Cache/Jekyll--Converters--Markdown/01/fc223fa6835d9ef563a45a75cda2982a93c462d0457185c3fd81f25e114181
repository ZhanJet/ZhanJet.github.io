* 01/2019 - 07/2020, Research Assistant,  [PolyU] (È¶ôÊ∏ØÁêÜÂ∑•) &amp; [HKU] (È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ§ßÂ≠¶)
  * Builded the lab‚Äôs experimental platform consisting of motion capture system(Vicon) and hardware of MAVs.
  * Proposed an universal nonlinear disturbance observer which can be used to estimate both model uncertainties and external disturbances. A flight controller based on this observer and nonlinear dynamic inverse control was designed. Finally, experimental validation was implemented using MAV equipped with Pixracer running PX4.
