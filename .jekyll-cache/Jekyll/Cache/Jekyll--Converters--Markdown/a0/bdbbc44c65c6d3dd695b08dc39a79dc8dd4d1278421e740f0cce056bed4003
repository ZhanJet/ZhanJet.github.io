    <ul>
      <li>Work on the strand of <em>Multi-Agent Collaborative Manipulation</em> of [UoE-AIRS Joint Project]</li>
      <li>Developed a Whole-Body Controller for mobile-manipulators based on Dynamic Motion Primitive (DMP) for intuitive human-robot collaboration.</li>
      <li>Developed Force Control software including admittace control, force tracking and hybrid impedance/force control for manipulators mounted F/T sensor on end-effector.</li>

* 01/2019 - 07/2020, Research Assistant,  [PolyU] (香港理工) &amp; [HKU] (香港大学)
  * Builded the lab’s experimental platform consisting of motion capture system(Vicon) and hardware of MAVs.
  *
  * Proposed an universal nonlinear disturbance observer which can be used to estimate both model uncertainties and external disturbances. A flight controller based on this observer and nonlinear dynamic inverse control was designed. Finally, experimental validation was implemented using MAV equipped with Pixracer running PX4.
