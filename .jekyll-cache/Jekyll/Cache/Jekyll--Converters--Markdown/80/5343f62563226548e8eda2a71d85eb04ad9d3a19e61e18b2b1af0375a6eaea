<p><img src="/images/coffee.jpg" class="floatpic" />
I drink a lot of coffee, and especially enjoy light roast espresso.  These
lighter roasts allow the flavors of the different types of coffee beans to
stand out more.  Starting in 2009, I roasted my coffee from green coffee beans.
I started out using the oven, then later switched utilizing a series of home
roasting machines.  For those looking to get into coffee roasting, I would
recommend a <a href="https://behmor.com/behmor-1600-plus/">Behmor 1600</a>.  I enjoy trying new types of coffee beans and
building tables to explore the search space of roasting parameters.</p>

<p>I love extremely spicy food and cooking. I taught myself cooking by trying
to reproduce spicy dishes I like and with the help of many friends who have
taught me dishes from their home countries. Recently I have been learning
Thai dishes.  I am always up to learn how to to cook a exotic new dish.</p>

In my free time I do powerlifting to stay healthy.  While it has been many
years since I competed, I still frequently train.</p>

<p>I previously enjoyed skiing, sailing, horseback riding, climbing, hiking,
and developing/playing computer games. However, I have not had time to do
any of these things recently.</p>
