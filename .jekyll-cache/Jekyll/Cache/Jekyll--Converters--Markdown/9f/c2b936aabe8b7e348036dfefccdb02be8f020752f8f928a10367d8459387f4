<strong>Hi there!</strong> Iâ€™m currently a research engineer at <a href="https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en/">Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society</a>  (<a href="https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en/">AIRS</a>), mainly working on the <em>Multi-Agent Collaborative Manipulation</em> strand of <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/slmc/research/projects-and-grants/uoe-airs-joint-project">UoE-AIRS Joint Project</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, after receiving my B.Sc and M.Eng degrees both from <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, I worked in industry and developed <a href="https://www.rokae.com/product1">an advanced collaborative robot</a> with torque sensors on each joint as a core member of the algorithm group. Afterwards, I went to Hong Kong and worked as a research assistant with Dr. Peng Lu and Dr. Jia Pan successively.</p>

<p>I am interested in applying advanced control techniques to robots that are able to interact with the environment and more collaborative with humans. Now, I am mainly working on developing adaptive control algorithms on mobile-manipulators for efficient human-robot collaboration to improve the working efficiency in factories.</p>
