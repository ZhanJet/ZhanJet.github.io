<p>Hi there! Iâ€™m currently a research engineer at <a href="https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en/">Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society</a>  (<a href="https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en/">AIRS</a>), mainly participating in the <em>Multi-Agent Collaborative Manipulation</em> strand of <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/slmc/research/projects-and-grants/uoe-airs-joint-project">UoE-AIRS Joint Project</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, after receiving my B.Sc and M.Eng degrees both from Beihang University, I have ever worked in industry and developed <a href="https://www.rokae.com/product1">an advanced collaborative robot</a> with torque sensors on each joint as a core member. Afterwards, I went to Hong Kong and worked as a research assistant with Dr. Peng Lu and Dr. Jia Pan successively.</p>

<p>I am interested in applying advanced control techniques to robots that are safer with the environment and more collaborative with humans. Now, I am mainly working on developing adaptive control algorithm for human-robot collaboration to improve the working efficiency in manufacturingfactories.</p>
