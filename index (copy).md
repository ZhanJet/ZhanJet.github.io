Hi there! I'm currently a research engineer at [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society]  \([AIRS]\), mainly participating in the *Multi-Agent Collaborative Manipulation* strand of [UoE-AIRS Joint Project].

Previously, after receiving my B.Sc and M.Eng degrees both from Beihang University, I have ever worked in industry and developed [an advanced collaborative robot] with torque sensors on each joint as a core member. Afterwards, I went to Hong Kong and worked as a research assistant with Dr. Peng Lu and Dr. Jia Pan successively.

I am interested in applying advanced control techniques to robots that are safer with the environment and more collaborative with humans. Now, I am mainly working on developing adaptive control algorithm for human-robot collaboration to improve the working efficiency in manufacturingfactories.
